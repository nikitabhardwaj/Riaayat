    <h5 id="heading2"> What is volunteering? Why is it important? You might be surprised!</h5>
    <p class="para">When you look at the reasons why volunteering is important, it’s not only about the impacts we can make in the lives of those
      less fortunate but the role it can play in making us more tolerant individuals and giving towards the global community.
      Each of us should be willing to offer our own time and expect nothing in return. But the truth is that volunteering will bring a world of rewards you might never have expected.
      So exactly why is volunteering important?</p>
      <p class="para">Unfortunately, not everyone is born into a life of opportunity and sometimes just the country you grow up in will dictate a life of hardship and poverty.
        Those of us that do live in countries where housing, education, safety and health care are basic and upheld rights have a
        responsibility to assist those that struggle for these things on a daily basis.</p>
        <p class="para">We grow up expecting that our good behavior or actions will always bring us rewards in return. But what about doing good deeds and extending a helping hand to others
          just because you should? Volunteering can bring a whole host of benefits to participants when it comes to boosting their job prospects or enhancing their self-confidence and skills,
          but it should be approached with an openness that asks for nothing in return.</p>
          <h5 id="heading3">What you can do?</h5>
          <p class="para">Prepare. Don't panic. it's our duty to help our nation in the critical phase.
            Simply be a part of us and see how it feels. </p>
